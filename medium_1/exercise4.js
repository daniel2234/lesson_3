// Question 4
// Alyssa was asked to write an implementation of a rolling buffer.
// You can add and remove elements from a rolling buffer. 
//However, once the buffer becomes full, any new elements will displace the oldest elements in the buffer.

// She wrote two implementations of the code for adding elements to the buffer. 
//In presenting the code to her team leader, 
//she said "Take your pick. Do you prefer push() or concat() for modifying the buffer?".

// Is there a difference between these implementations, 
//other than the method she used to add an element to the buffer?

/* TODO */
